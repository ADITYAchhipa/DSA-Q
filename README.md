# 🚀 DSA Daily Practice

> **Consistent problem-solving focused on clarity, correctness, and interview readiness.**

This repository documents my structured **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice. The goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand patterns, write clean solutions, and explain them clearly**.

---

## 🎯 Why this repository?

* To build **strong fundamentals** in DSA
* To practice **writing interview-ready solutions**
* To maintain **consistency over time**
* To track learning progress publicly

This is a **learning-first repo**, not just a submission dump.

---

## 🧠 What you’ll find here

Each problem includes:

* ✅ Problem statement (with source link)
* ✅ Difficulty level
* ✅ Clear approach / intuition
* ✅ Clean, readable solution code
* ✅ Time & space complexity

Languages used:

* **Java** (primary)
* Occasionally **Python** (when suitable)

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
.
dsa-q/
├── problem1.java
├── problem2.java
└── README.md
```

Each file focuses on **one problem only**, keeping explanations concise and interview-oriented.

---

## 🧩 Problem Sources

Problems are selected from:

* **LeetCode**
* **GeeksforGeeks**
* **CodeChef** (DSA-focused problems)

Selection criteria:

* Frequently asked in interviews
* Covers core patterns (arrays, hashing, stacks, recursion, DP, graphs)

---

## 📈 Learning Philosophy

* **Quality > Quantity**
* Revisit & refactor old solutions
* Focus on *why* a solution works
* Prefer clarity over clever tricks

Some days may have no commits — that’s intentional. Understanding matters more than streaks.

---

## 🔁 Consistency

Problems are added regularly to maintain discipline and long-term momentum. Commit frequency may vary, but each solution is written with care.

---

## 🧪 Topics Covered

* Arrays & Strings
* Hashing
* Stacks & Queues
* Linked Lists
* Trees & BSTs
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Graphs (BFS / DFS)

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

Grateful to the learning community and mentors whose content made DSA approachable:

* **Kunal Kushwaha**
* **Striver (Raj Vikramaditya)**
* Platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **CodeChef** for providing free, high-quality practice resources
