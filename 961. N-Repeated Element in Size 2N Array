//  tag Easy

//  problem
//  You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:

//  nums.length == 2 * n.
//  nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
//  Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
//  Return the element that is repeated n times.


// Explanation

// If we ever find a repeated element, it must be the answer. Let's call this answer the major element.

// Consider all subarrays of length 4. There must be a major element in at least one such subarray.

// This is because either:

// There is a major element in a length 2 subarray, or;
// Every length 2 subarray has exactly 1 major element, which means that a length 4 subarray that begins at a major element will have 2 major elements.
// Thus, we only have to compare elements with their neighbors that are distance 1, 2, or 3 away.


class Solution {
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] A) {
        for (int k = 1; k <= 3; ++k)
            for (int i = 0; i < A.length - k; ++i)
                if (A[i] == A[i+k])
                    return A[i];

        throw null;
    }
